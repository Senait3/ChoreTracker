# ChoreTracker

# Purpose 
  The purpose of this console based application is to allow users to download and use as a method of chore assigning for their specific household. Users can download all files and run the program. Firstly users have the choice of signing in or creating a new account. For first time users its reccomended that the parent make the account because when they are signing up there will be a section that will ask for a PIN number and that is so that parent-only aspects of the program can be accessed by the Parent only. When signing in Users will be prompted to choose either the kids account which has not required PIN or the parents account that has a required PIN
  
# Parental Use 
   The parental account has the option to add children, assign tasks to children, view task completion, send allowance, and send messages. When assigning a task the user has the option to assign it to any child, then later on they can view the tasks completion status which will be shown in two categories, complete vs. incomplete. When sending a message the parent also has the option to delete the message but if they don't want to send anything they have the option of just viewing. 
   
# Child Use
  The child account has the option to view assigned tasks, mark their completion status, view allowance, and send messages to the parental account. When marking the completion of a task the child will be asked to verify their choice. If they wanted to mark the wrong task on accident there is still that safety net where they can just go back and none of the tasks will be changed. When they do finish a task and want to mark it as so it will not appear in their list of assigned tasks anymore it will just be gone and will be marked correctly for the parental side. Children have the same messaging acessabilities as the parents and same functionalities.
